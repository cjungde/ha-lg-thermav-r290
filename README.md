# LG ThermaV R290 — Home Assistant Integration

HACS custom integration for the LG ThermaV R290 heat pump via Modbus TCP or RTU.

Replaces a hand-crafted YAML Modbus configuration with native HA entities: sensors, binary sensors, switches, buttons, number inputs, and select dropdowns — all updated on every poll cycle without requiring template sensors or automations.

## Features

- **Sensors** — temperatures (inlet, outlet, DHW, outdoor, refrigerant circuit), flow rate, pressures, compressor speed, error code, operation mode, control method, energy state
- **Computed thermal power sensors** — total / heating circuit / DHW, calculated from flow rate and ΔT each poll cycle (Q = flow/60 × ΔT × 4186 W)
- **Binary sensors** — compressor, pumps, DHW heating, defrost, backup heater stages, fault, silent mode, cooling, emergency modes, energy state slots 0–8
- **Switches** — main power, DHW, silent mode, emergency stop
- **Buttons** — start DHW disinfection (momentary trigger coil)
- **Number inputs** — flow temperature setpoints (circuit 1, circuit 2), DHW target temperature, heating curve shift values (circuit 1, circuit 2)
- **Select inputs** — operation mode (Heating / Cooling / Auto), control method (outlet temp / inlet temp / room air)
- Supports **Modbus TCP**, **Modbus TCP-RTU**, and **Modbus RTU** (serial)
- Configurable poll interval (default 30 s), reconfigurable without restart

| `binary_sensor.lg_thermav_r290_water_pump` | Water pump running |
| `binary_sensor.lg_thermav_r290_external_water_pump` | External water pump |

> **Note on discrete input 10001 (water flow).** The LG manual documents this bit as
> `0 = flow rate OK / 1 = flow rate too low`. On the R290 monoblock it behaves the
> other way round: the bit is set while water is flowing. Measured on 2026-08-18 —
> `di[0] = 0` at 5.0 LPM with the pump off, `di[0] = 1` at 15.3 and 29.5 LPM with the
> pump running, with `di[0]` and `di[1]` (pump) identical in every sample of the same
> poll. A read offset is ruled out, since `di[3]` (compressor) and `di[5]` (DHW heating)
> stay correctly aligned.
>
> The entity is therefore exposed as `binary_sensor.lg_thermav_r290_water_flow` with
> device class `running`. Up to and including v0.x it was named
> `..._water_flow_insufficient` with device class `problem`, which raised a false
> problem alert on every pump run. **After updating, the old entity remains in the
> registry as `unavailable` and can be removed manually.**

### Switches

| Entity | Modbus coil |
|---|---|
| `switch.lg_thermav_r290_heat_pump` | Coil 0 |
| `switch.lg_thermav_r290_dhw` | Coil 1 |
| `switch.lg_thermav_r290_silent_mode` | Coil 2 |
| `switch.lg_thermav_r290_emergency_stop` | Coil 4 |

### Buttons

Coil 3 is a momentary trigger, not a state switch. The manual specifies it as
`0: hold status / 1: start operation` — the unit clears the coil by itself after
the write, so reading it back is never a confirmation. Use the binary sensor to
see whether the operation actually started.

| Entity | Modbus coil | Status entity |
|---|---|---|
| `button.lg_thermav_r290_start_disinfection` | Coil 3 (trigger) | `binary_sensor.lg_thermav_r290_dhw_disinfection` (discrete 6) |

> **Breaking change in 0.0.11:** this replaces `switch.lg_thermav_r290_disinfection_mode`,
> which modelled a trigger coil as a switch and therefore always read back `off`,
> even when the write succeeded. **After updating, the old switch remains in the
> registry as `unavailable` and can be removed manually.** Note that the trigger
> only has an effect if disinfection is enabled on the unit itself
> (installer menu → DHW → disinfection active; factory default is off).

### Number inputs

## Notes

- Thermal power formula: `Q [W] = (flow_rate [l/min] / 60) × (outlet_temp − inlet_temp) [K] × 4186 [J/(l·K)]`
- Heating circuit / DHW split is based on the `di_dhw_heating` discrete input; when DHW is active the full flow is attributed to DHW and the heating circuit sensor reports 0, and vice versa.
- Shift values (holding regs 4, 7) are stored as two's-complement uint16; values ≥ 32768 are interpreted as negative.
- Tested on LG ThermaV R290 9 kW via Modbus TCP, slave ID 33.
